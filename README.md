## Local Setup

1. Copy environment files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

`backend/.env` is required for backend, Prisma migration, and seed commands because backend workspace commands run from the `backend/` directory. Keep real secrets in ignored local env files.

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start PostgreSQL and Redis locally:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

4. Generate Prisma client:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

5. Run database migration:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

6. Seed the SinSoftware Solutions Super Admin:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

7. Optionally seed a realistic demo tenant:

```bash
npm run db:seed:demo
```

8. Start development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Default ports:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5001/api`

## Authentication

Seed login uses the values from your environment:

- `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

Login endpoint:

```bash
POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login
```

Body:

```json
{
  "email": "admin@sinsoftware.in",
  "password": "your-secure-password"
}
```

Auth APIs:

- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/auth/me`

See `docs/SEEDING.md` for secure seed instructions.

## Demo Data

Phase 10 adds a safe demo seed for sales walkthroughs and end-to-end QA readiness.

Run:

```bash
npm run db:seed:demo
```

The demo seed creates:

- Super Admin.
- Demo company: `Sharma Roadlines Demo`.
- Company code: `SHARMA_ROADLINES_DEMO`.
- Company Admin: `admin@sharmaroadlines.demo`.
- 10 vehicles, 9 drivers, 6 clients, 20 trips, diesel entries, expenses, payments, outstanding balances, and expiring documents.

Credential safety:

- Set `DEMO_SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `DEMO_COMPANY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your ignored local env for repeatable demos.
- If demo passwords are not supplied, temporary passwords are generated and printed by the seed command.
- Do not commit real passwords.
- Re-running the seed updates existing demo records and avoids duplicate demo trips/bills/payments.
- Set `DEMO_RESET=true` only when you explicitly want to delete and recreate the `SHARMA_ROADLINES_DEMO` tenant.

QA checklist: `docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md`.

Seeded browser QA runbook: `docs/SEEDED_BROWSER_QA_RUNBOOK.md`.

Optional seeded API smoke test after `npm run dev`:

```bash
npm run smoke:seeded
```

The smoke test checks health, Super Admin login, Company Admin login, and core authenticated routes. It requires stable demo passwords in `backend/.env` or exported shell variables.

These routes require a `COMPANY_ADMIN` or `USER` access token and always use the authenticated user's `companyId`.

Exports are generated on the backend with `pdfkit` and `exceljs`, use safe attachment filenames, and write `EXPORT` audit events under the `exports` module. See `docs/EXPORTS.md`.

Company audit APIs:

- `GET /api/company/audit-logs`

Audit logs are now available inside both Admin and Company workspaces for demo review of exports, soft deletes, status changes, and operational updates. See `docs/MISSING_GAPS_AUDIT.md` for the latest demo/client readiness audit.

## Required Memory Files

The following files must be updated after every major implementation step:

- `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `NEXT_TASKS.md`
- `AI_CONTEXT.md`
- `changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name.md`

## UI Guidelines

Phase 9 premium UI guidance lives in `docs/UI_GUIDELINES.md`.

## Industrial Hardening

The industrial hardening pass adds practical SaaS controls for real transport operators:

- Frontend route protection for Super Admin and Company workspaces.
- Automatic access-token refresh and session-expiry logout handling.
- Auth API rate limiting.
- Helmet security headers and strict configured CORS origins.
- Request IDs and structured backend logging with secret redaction.
- Input sanitization for request body/query values.
- `AuditLog` model and audit read APIs.
- Confirm-delete UX for soft-delete actions.
- Safer trip resource status recalculation and payment balance reversal handling.
- Graceful backend shutdown and safer health metadata.
